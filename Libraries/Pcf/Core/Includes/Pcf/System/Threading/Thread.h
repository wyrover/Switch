      /// <b>Starting a Thread</b>
      ///
      /// You start a thread by supplying a delegate that represents the method the thread is to execute in its class constructor. You then call the Start method to begin execution.
      ///
      /// The Thread constructors can take either of two delegate types, depending on whether you can pass an argument to the method to be executed:
      ///  * If the method has no arguments, you pass a ThreadStart delegate to the constructor. It has the signature:
      /// @code using ThreadStart = delegate<void> @endcode
      ///
      /// The following example creates and starts a thread that executes the ExecuteInForeground method. The method displays information about some thread properties, then executes a loop in which it pauses for half a second and displays the elapsed number of seconds. When the thread has executed for at least five seconds, the loop ends and the thread terminates execution.
      /// @include Thread1.cpp
      ///
      /// * If the method has an argument, you pass a ParameterizedThreadStart delegate to the constructor. It has the signature:
      /// @code using ParameterizedThreadStart = delegate<void, const object&> @endcode
      ///
      /// The method executed by the delegate can then cast with as<T>(...) the parameter to the appropriate type.
      ///
      /// The following example is identical to the previous one, except that it calls the Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart) constructor. This version of the ExecuteInForeground method has a single parameter that represents the approximate number of milliseconds the loop is to execute.
      /// @include Thread2.cpp
      /// It is not necessary to join. The thread is joined auomaticaly when destroyed. The thread continues to execute until the thread procedure is complete.
      ///
      /// <b>Retrieving Thread objects</b>
      ///
      /// You can use the static CurrentThread property to retrieve a reference to the currently executing thread from the code that the thread is executing. The following example uses the CurrentThread property to display information about the main application thread, another foreground thread, a background thread, and a thread pool thread.
      /// @include Thread3.cpp
      ///
      /// <b>Foreground and background threads</b>
      ///
      /// Instances of the Thread class represent either foreground threads or background threads. Background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep a process running if all foreground threads have terminated. Once all foreground threads have been stopped, the runtime stops all background threads and shuts down.
      ///
      /// By default, the following threads execute in the foreground:
      /// * The main application thread.
      /// * All threads created by calling a Thread class constructor.
      ///
      /// The following threads execute in the background by default:
      /// * Thread pool threads, which are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime. You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the ThreadPool class.
      ///   @note Task-based asynchronous operations automatically execute on thread pool threads. Task-based asynchronous operations use the Task and Task<TResult> classes to implement the task-based asynchronous pattern.
      /// * All threads not created by calling a Thread class constructor.
      ///
      /// You can change a thread to execute in the background by setting the IsBackground property at any time. Background threads are useful for any operation that should continue as long as an application is running but should not prevent the application from terminating, such as monitoring file system changes or incoming socket connections.
      ///
      /// The following example illustrates the difference between foreground and background threads. It is like the first example in the Starting a thread section, except that it sets the thread to execute in the background before starting it. As the output shows, the loop is interrupted before it executes for five seconds.
      /// @include Thread4.cpp
      ///
      /// <b>Getting information about and controlling threads</b>
      ///
      /// You can retrieve a number of property values that provide information about a thread. In some cases, you can also set these property values to control the operation of the thread. These thread properties include:
      /// * A name. Name is a write-once property that you can use to identify a thread. Its default value is empty.
      /// * A hash code, which you can retrieve by calling the GetHashCode method. The hash code can be used to uniquely identify a thread; for the lifetime of your thread, its hash code will not collide with the value from any other thread, regardless of the application domain from which you obtain the value.
      /// * A thread ID. The value of the read-only ManagedThreadId property is assigned by the runtime and uniquely identifies a thread within its process.
      ///   @note For thread not created by calling a Thread class constructor this value is euqal to 0.
      /// * The thread's current state. For the duration of its existence, a thread is always in one or more of the states defined by the ThreadState property.
      /// * A scheduling priority level, which is defined by the ThreadPriority property. Although you can set this value to request a thread's priority, it is not guaranteed to be honored by the operating system.
      /// * The read-only IsThreadPoolThread property, which indicates whether a thread is a thread pool thread.
      /// * The IsBackground property. For more information, see the Foreground and background threads section.
