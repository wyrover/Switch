        /// @remarks The Socket class follows the .NET Framework naming pattern for asynchronous methods. For example, the synchronous Receive method corresponds to the asynchronous BeginReceive and EndReceive methods.
        /// @remarks If your application only requires one thread during execution, use the following methods, which are designed for synchronous operation mode.
        /// @remarks If you are using a connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, your server can listen for connections using the Listen method. The Accept method processes any incoming connection requests and returns a Socket that you can use to communicate data with the remote host. Use this returned Socket to call the Send or Receive method. Call the Bind method prior to calling the Listen method if you want to specify the local IP address and port number. Use a port number of zero if you want the underlying service provider to assign a free port for you. If you want to connect to a listening host, call the Connect method. To communicate data, call the Send or Receive method.
        /// @remarks If you are using a connectionless protocol such as UDP, you do not need to listen for connections at all. Call the ReceiveFrom method to accept any incoming datagrams. Use the SendTo method to send datagrams to a remote host.

        /// @remarks If you are using a connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, use the Socket, BeginConnect, and EndConnect methods to connect with a listening host. Use the BeginSend and EndSend or BeginReceive and EndReceive methods to communicate data asynchronously. Incoming connection requests can be processed using BeginAccept and EndAccept.
        /// @remarks If you are using a connectionless protocol such as UDP, you can use BeginSendTo and EndSendTo to send datagrams, and BeginReceiveFrom and EndReceiveFrom to receive datagrams.
