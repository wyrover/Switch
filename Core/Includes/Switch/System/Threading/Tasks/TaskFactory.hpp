In addition to classes for synchronizing thread activities and access to data ( Mutex, Monitor, Interlocked, AutoResetEvent, and so on), this namespace includes a ThreadPool class that allows you to use a pool of system-supplied threads, and a Timer class that executes callback methods on thread pool threads.

The main types are System::Threading::Tasks::Task which represents an asynchronous operation that can be waited on and cancelled, and System::Threading::Tasks::Task<TResult>, which is a task that can return a value. The System::Threading::Tasks::TaskFactory class provides static methods for creating and starting tasks, and the System::Threading::Tasks::TaskScheduler class provides the default thread scheduling infrastructure.
